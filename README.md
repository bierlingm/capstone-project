# FloWriter

An app for flow entry through digital writing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Basic Idea

Meditation allows me to process unresolved emotions and develop a sense of calm. Writing, especially journaling, allows me to do the same. With this app I aim to provide the user with a meditative experience through a specific form of writing I call 'ephemeral writing'.

## Context

This app is my capstone project for the [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de) web developer bootcamp I participated in during spring 2020.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
