# Capstone Project: Meditation by Writing App
4 weeks, 1 app, infinite growth

## Basic Idea
Meditation allows me to process unresolved emotions and develop a sense of calm. Writing, especially journaling, allows me to do the same. With this app I aim to provide the user with a meditative experience through a specific form of writing I call 'ephemeral writing'.
